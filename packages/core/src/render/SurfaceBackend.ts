/**
 * Low-level GPU surface backend.
 *
 * Abstracts canvas + context lifecycle, viewport / scissor regions, clear,
 * compositing into a 2D canvas overlay, and teardown. Both the existing
 * WebGL surface (`src/core/renderers/webgl/sharedWebGLSurface.ts`) and the
 * P1 WebGPU surface implement this contract.
 *
 * This file is **pure interface** — no implementation. It exists so that:
 *
 * 1. Existing WebGL code can declare conformance via a one-line adapter
 *    (see `createLegacyWebGLBackend` below) without changing any behaviour.
 * 2. P1's WebGPU implementation has a fixed target to write against.
 * 3. The higher-level `Renderer` (`./Renderer.ts`) can compose a backend
 *    without knowing which GPU API it sits on.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - All region coordinates are in **logical pixels** with the surface
 *   responsible for DPR scaling internally. This matches the existing
 *   `WebGLRegion` semantics so the legacy adapter is a transparent pass-through.
 * - `compositeTo` takes a 2D `CanvasRenderingContext2D` because the chart's
 *   final composition target is a 2D overlay canvas — WebGL/WebGPU pixels
 *   are drawn into the overlay via `drawImage`. Future paths that bypass
 *   the 2D overlay (direct-to-screen WebGPU) can leave `compositeTo` as a no-op.
