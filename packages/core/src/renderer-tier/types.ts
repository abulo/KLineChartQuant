/**
 * Renderer tier types.

 * `RendererTier` is a totally-ordered enum (`'webgpu' > 'webgl2' >
 * 'canvas2d' > 'none'`). Consumers pick the highest tier the host
 * environment supports and configure the {@link Renderer} accordingly.
 *
 * Why a string union (not a numeric enum):
 *   - Logs and analytics stay human-readable.
 *   - Tree-shakable; no runtime enum object.
 *   - Cross-package safe — string equality survives serialization
 *     and avoids the "two enum copies don't compare" footgun.
