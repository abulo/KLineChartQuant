/**
 * Layer factory registry.
 *
 * The registry is a tiny lookup table from a stable string `typeId` to a
 * factory function that builds a `Layer` instance. It exists so that:
 *
 * 1. Chart adapters can choose which built-in layer types to wire in,
 *    rather than the core forcing all of them on every consumer.
 * 2. Component layers built by sibling agents (Volume Profile, Order Book
 *    Heatmap, Footprint) register their factories without touching the
 *    scene code itself — the registry is the integration point.
 * 3. The registry is decoupled from `Scene`: a factory produces a `Layer`;
 *    the consumer is responsible for calling `scene.addLayer(layer)`. This
 *    avoids forcing every consumer through a single "register + auto-add"
 *    pipeline that would be hard to compose with config-driven scenes.
 *
 * This PR does NOT pre-register any factories — that's a follow-up PR
 * once the legacy WebGL renderers have adapters that satisfy the `Layer`
 * interface. This file ships the registry mechanism plus the canonical
 * `typeId` constants so the rest of the codebase can reference layer types
 * by symbol rather than magic string.
