/**
 * Scene + Layer type definitions.
 *
 * The scene is the level above `render` in core's dependency stack
 * (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` §0):
 *
 *     interaction → store → scene → render
 *
 * A `Layer` is a self-contained drawing module — candles, volume bars,
 * indicator plots, drawings, crosshair, and the P1 component layers
 * (Volume Profile, Order Book Heatmap, Footprint) all conform to the same
 * shape. The scene composes layers, owns ordering, and drives per-frame
 * paint dispatch; it does NOT know which GPU backend is underneath
 * because `paint()` only sees a `Renderer` reference via `PaintContext`.
 *
 * This file is **pure interface** — `createScene.ts` implements `Scene`,
 * but the types here are zero-runtime so framework adapters and indicator
 * controllers can compile against them without pulling in the implementation.

 * Roles let the scene group layers and let other systems target them

 * The ordering here is informational, not enforced — z-order is the

 * features like "hit-test only drawing + component layers" without
 * peeking at layer ids.

/**
 * Which pane a layer belongs to. The chart has a main pane (candles +
 * primary indicators) and zero-or-more sub panes (volume, RSI, MACD).
 * Layers declare their pane statically; the scene's `paintPane` filters
 * by this field so each pane's region only sees its own layers.
 *
 * NOTE for implementations: this PR uses a flat 'main' / 'sub' split.
 * If a future iteration needs to address a specific sub-pane (e.g. the
 * volume pane vs the RSI pane), extend this to a string id (e.g. 'sub:rsi')
 * — the Layer / Scene contract here does not pre-commit a multi-sub-pane
 * scheme on purpose.

/**
 * Stateless paint context handed to each layer per frame.
 *
 * The layer reads what it needs from the store via subscriptions
 * (the store reference is held by the layer itself, set up at construction
 * time by its factory); this context is the per-frame state.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - `renderer` MUST already be inside a `beginFrame` / `endFrame` pair
 *   when paint runs. The scene does not call beginFrame/endFrame itself —
 *   that's the chart engine's responsibility (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` §0
 *   for the layered call chain).
 * - `region` is the surface region for the pane currently being painted.
 *   Layers MUST treat all coordinates as logical pixels relative to this
 *   region's origin (the renderer's surface handles DPR scaling).
 * - `frameNumber` is monotonic across the chart's lifetime; layers can use
 *   it to drive animations or detect skipped frames.
 * - `deltaMs` is the wall-clock delta since the previous paint of any pane,
 *   in milliseconds. May be `0` on the very first frame.

 * A Layer is a self-contained drawing module.

 * The contract:
 * - Pure function `paint()`: given context, produce GPU commands.
 * - `paint()` MUST NOT mutate any shared state visible to other layers.
 *   Layer-private state (cached buffers, last-seen frame number) is fine.
 * - `paint()` runs in scene-defined order; order matters for visual stacking
 *   (lower z paints first, so higher-z layers visually sit on top).
 * - `dispose()` MUST release any renderer resources the layer allocated
 *   (buffers, pipelines). After dispose, the layer is dead — the scene
 *   removes it and will not call paint again.
 * - `visible` is a runtime toggle. Invisible layers are skipped entirely
 *   (no paint() call); the layer keeps its allocated resources so a flip
 *   back to visible is cheap.
