/**
 * Range Bars — fixed-range price bars.
 *
 * Every output bar spans exactly `range` price units (high - low === range at
 * close). When the active bar's range reaches the threshold it is closed and
 * a new bar begins, opening at the trigger price. Time, like Renko and P&F,
 * is collapsed.
 *
 * ## Why range bars over Renko
 *
 *  - **Renko** uses only the close; intra-bar wicks are invisible. Good for
 *    long-term swing visualisation.
 *  - **Range bars** use the entire (high, low) of every input bar. They show
 *    intra-bar excursions and tend to be more responsive to spikes.
 *
 * ## Algorithm
 *
 * State carries the in-progress bar `{open, high, low, volume, ...}`. For each
 * input bar:
 *
 *   1. Decide a *direction* for the input bar (`up` if close >= open, else
 *      `down`). Range bars need a direction because OHLC bars don't carry the
 *      tick-level path between low and high.
 *   2. Merge the input bar into the open bar BUT only along the direction —
 *      meaning we honour both high and low, but if the merged span exceeds
 *      `range` we *carve* the range bar in the direction of motion.
 *   3. Carving: an "up" input that pushes total span past `range` closes the
 *      current bar at `low + range`. The carved excess starts the next bar
 *      with `open = low + range`, and any remaining high above the carved
 *      ceiling becomes the next bar's high (recursion).
 *   4. Edge case: a single input bar with `high - low > range` walks the bar's
 *      range in `range`-sized steps in the input's direction and emits one
 *      output bar per full step.
 *
 * ## Direction heuristic for OHLC inputs
 *
 * When closing from a single input contribution, we use `input.close >= input.open`
 * to choose the carve direction. This is the same heuristic TradingView uses
 * with OHLC input — exact tick-by-tick directionality would require trades.
 *
 * ## Volume aggregation
 *
 * Volume is summed across every input bar that contributes any range. For a
 * single input that produces multiple output bars (a split), the input's
 * volume is divided proportionally to the price extent each output bar
 * carves of the input bar's total H-L.
 *
 * ## Emission strategy
 *
 * `transform()` returns every closed bar PLUS the currently-open bar (mirrors
 * a live chart). `appendBar()` returns only the bars that closed on this
 * append — the open bar is held in state. Tests assert the closed prefix
 * matches between modes.
