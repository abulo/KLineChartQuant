/**
 * Renko bricks — price-based bars that ignore time.
 *
 * A Renko chart drops a fixed-size "brick" every time price advances by one
 * brick-size from the previous brick's close. Time is collapsed: a quiet hour
 * may produce zero bricks, a volatile minute may produce ten.
 *
 * ## Modes
 *
 *  - **Fixed brick size** (`{ brickSize }`): the classic chart. Brick height
 *    is constant across the entire series.
 *  - **ATR-adaptive brick size** (`{ useATR: { period } }`): brick size is the
 *    rolling ATR(period) over the *input* OHLCV series. We compute the full
 *    ATR series upfront and then use, for each candidate brick, the **trailing
 *    ATR at the source bar that triggered it**. This means brick height varies
 *    along the chart — wider in volatile regimes, tighter in quiet ones —
 *    which is the whole point of ATR mode.
 *
 *    Trade-off (documented because it's a real one): ATR bricks are NOT
 *    uniform-height, so the chart loses the "every step is the same size"
 *    visual property that classical Renko has. In return, the brick rhythm
 *    adapts to volatility — a feature TradingView only offers in a separate
 *    chart-type ("ATR Renko") and which requires the user to reload the
 *    series to change. Our implementation supports flipping `useATR` on a
 *    live transform incrementally — see §"Enhancements over TradingView".
 *
 * ## Classic reversal rule (the 2× brick-size requirement)
 *
 * Once a column of up-bricks has been emitted, a single brick-size reverse
 * move is NOT enough to start a down-column — it must travel **2 × brickSize**
 * in the opposite direction from the last brick's close. This is the
 * "classic" Nison/Steve Nison rule. Without the 2× requirement the chart
 * "flutters" — every wiggle near the brick-size threshold flips direction.
 *
 * In code:
 *   - Continuation (same direction as last brick): need ≥ 1 × brickSize.
 *   - Reversal (opposite direction): need ≥ 2 × brickSize.
 *
 * The very first brick has no "previous direction", so it uses the 1× rule.
 *
 * ## Brick shape
 *
 * Each brick is OHLCV-shaped to fit the candle renderer:
 *
 *     up-brick:   open = lastBrickClose
 *                 close = lastBrickClose + brickSize
 *                 high = close, low = open
 *
 *     down-brick: open = lastBrickClose
 *                 close = lastBrickClose - brickSize
 *                 high = open, low = close
 *
 * `volume` is the sum of input-bar volumes assigned to this brick. We use a
 * simple rule: each input bar contributes all of its volume to **the first
 * brick** it triggers in that bar. When one bar triggers N bricks (a gap),
 * the bar's full volume goes on the first brick and the rest carry zero. This
 * matches TradingView; the alternative (split evenly) creates phantom volume
 * spikes when ATR mode changes brick sizes between bricks.
 *
 * ## Meta
 *
 * `meta.direction` is `'up'` or `'down'` for downstream colour selection.
 * `meta.brickSize` is the brick height at the time of emission (especially
 * meaningful in ATR mode).
