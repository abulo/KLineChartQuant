/**
 * Chart-type transformers — public type contract.
 *
 * A "chart type" in TradingView (Heikin Ashi, Renko, P&F, Range Bars, etc.) is
 * a **data transform**, not a different renderer. Every output is still
 * OHLCV-shaped, so the same candle renderer paints all of them. This package
 * is therefore deliberately headless: rendering belongs to the
 * Renderer/Scene layer (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` §0).
 *
 * Why this matters for the WebGPU path: because the output is OHLCV, the
 * existing instanced-quad K-line vertex pipeline (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` §2.3)
 * draws Heikin Ashi / Renko / P&F / Range Bars at the same throughput as raw
 * candles — no new render path, no new shader.
 *
 * ## Two transforms in one interface — batch vs incremental
 *
 * Every transform here supports two modes:
 *
 *  - **Batch** (`transform`): pure function over an OHLCV slice. Re-derives the
 *    output from scratch. Use this for chart loads / history scrolls.
 *  - **Incremental** (`appendBar`): consume one live bar at a time, emit zero
 *    or more output bars, and update internal state. Use this for streaming
 *    quotes.
 *
 * Calling `appendBar` repeatedly over the same sequence must produce **bit-for-
 * bit identical** output to a single `transform` over that sequence. The test
 * suite enforces this with a randomised property test on a ≥30-bar input.
 *
 * ## A note on time semantics
 *
 * Renko, P&F and Range Bars all break the "one input bar = one output bar"
 * assumption. We preserve provenance with `sourceBarIndexStart` /
 * `sourceBarIndexEnd` so callers can map back to the source series for
 * tooltips, x-axis labels, and event correlation. The `timestamp` on a
 * derived bar is the timestamp of the source bar that **closed** it (i.e. the
 * trigger).

 * aggregated into this output row (inclusive). For 1:1 transforms (Heikin
 * Ashi) they are equal. For aggregating transforms (Renko, P&F, Range Bars)
 * they describe a range of source rows. For "fanning" transforms — one input
 * bar that produces multiple output bars (large-gap Renko, oversized Range
 * bar) — every fanned-out output row shares the same start/end index.
