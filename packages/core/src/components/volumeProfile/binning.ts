/**
 * Bar-to-bucket volume distribution.
 *
 * Two modes, both described in `docs/ROADMAP.md` §3.1:
 *
 * - `typical-price` (fast, default): the bar's entire volume is added to the
 *   bucket containing the typical price `(high + low + close) / 3`. O(1) per
 *   bar. Good enough for live profiles and the case where each bar is small
 *   relative to the bucket size.
 *
 * - `proportional` (accurate): the bar's volume is split across every bucket
 *   that overlaps `[low, high]`, weighted by that bucket's price-range
 *   overlap with the bar. O(spanned buckets) per bar. Use this when bars
 *   span many buckets (e.g. higher timeframes, wide ranges).
 *
 * Both modes mutate the `buckets` array in place — the function is called in
 * a tight loop and we want zero allocations on the hot path. The controller
 * is responsible for zeroing the buckets before the first call.
 *
 * Out-of-range handling:
 *   - In `typical-price` mode a bar whose typical price falls outside
 *     `[binMin, binMin + binCount*binSize)` is **dropped silently**. The
 *     controller is responsible for sizing the price range so this only
 *     happens for accidentally bad inputs (e.g. zero-volume bars in a
 *     degenerate range).
 *   - In `proportional` mode the overlap with `[binMin, binMax]` is the
 *     effective contribution; a bar fully outside contributes nothing, a bar
 *     partially overlapping contributes proportionally.

 *
 * @param bar       The OHLC bar (only `high`/`low`/`close`/`volume` are read).

 * @param binMin    Low edge of bucket 0.
