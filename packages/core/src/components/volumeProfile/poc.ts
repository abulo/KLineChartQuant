/**
 * Point of Control — argmax over the bucket histogram.
 *
 * The POC is the single bucket with the largest total volume. It is the seed
 * for the Value Area expansion (`valueArea.ts`) and the most-referenced level
 * on a volume profile chart.
 *
 * Tie-breaker policy (important — make sure it stays stable):
 *   When two or more buckets share the maximum, the **lowest index wins**.
 *
 * Rationale: argmax under ties is otherwise undefined, which leads to
 * non-deterministic state across runs and breaks snapshot tests. Returning
 * the lowest index is also the convention KLineCharts and the maintainer's
 * legacy renderer follow, so the visual placement of the POC line is
 * consistent across our data model and the existing renderer.
 *
 * Edge case: an empty array returns `-1`. Callers (the controller) treat
 * that as "no profile" and emit `state = null`. We pick -1 (not 0) so the
 * empty case is impossible to confuse with "argmax happens to be bucket 0".
