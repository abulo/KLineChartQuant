/**
 * Volume Profile — public type contract.
 *
 * Volume Profile aggregates traded volume by **price** (not time), producing a
 * horizontal histogram pinned to the price axis. Traders read it for
 * accumulation zones (POC), the 70% Value Area (VAH/VAL — CME convention),
 * and developing support/resistance.
 *
 * This module owns the **data model + math only**. Rendering belongs to the
 * `@klinechart-quant/core` Renderer/Scene layer (or the maintainer's legacy
 * renderer at `src/core/renderers/Indicator/volumeProfile.ts`, which is kept
 * untouched per branch policy).
 *
 * See `docs/ROADMAP.md` §3.1 for the algorithm rationale and §0 for the
 * controller layering this fits into. See `computeShader.wgsl.md` for the
 * planned WebGPU compute path of the heavy `binBarToBuckets` work.

 * How a bar's volume is distributed across price buckets.

 *   the single bucket containing (high+low+close)/3. O(1) per bar.
 * - `proportional` — accurate. The bar volume is split across every bucket
 *   that overlaps `[low, high]`, proportional to that bucket's price-range
 *   overlap with the bar. O(buckets-spanned) per bar.
 *
 * The trade-off is laid out in `docs/ROADMAP.md` §3.1: typical-price is what
 * you want for live profile rendering at frame rate; proportional is what you
 * want for "true" historical profiles and TPO-style work.
