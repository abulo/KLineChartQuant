/**
 * Public types for the Multi-Timeframe (MTF) overlay module.
 *
 * Naming: "base" = the chart's primary timeframe (e.g. 5m), "higher tf" =
 * the resampled timeframe an MTF series lives on (e.g. 1h). The module never
 * downscales — you can only lift values from a coarser tf onto a finer one.
 *
 * Time semantics:
 *   - Every `timestamp` is in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
 *   - A base bar's `timestamp` is the OPEN of that bar's interval (aligned
 *     to `baseIntervalMs` boundary, implicitly).
 *   - A resampled (higher-tf) bar's `timestamp` is the OPEN of its bucket,
 *     computed as `floor(firstBaseBar.timestamp / targetIntervalMs) * targetIntervalMs`.
 *   - A higher-tf bar's interval is `[timestamp, timestamp + targetIntervalMs)`.
 *
 * The MTF controller does NOT bring its own indicator math. The caller
 * supplies a `compute` function that takes resampled bars and returns one
 * number per resampled bar. Any indicator (EMA, RSI, custom) can be lifted
 * to MTF by writing such a compute fn.
 */
