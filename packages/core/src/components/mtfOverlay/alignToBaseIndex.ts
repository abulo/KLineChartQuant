/**
 * Forward-fill a higher-timeframe series onto the base bar index, with strict
 * no-lookahead semantics.
 *
 * The rule, restated:
 *   A higher-tf bar opens at `hbar.timestamp` and covers the half-open
 *   interval `[hbar.timestamp, hbar.timestamp + targetIntervalMs)`. The
 *   higher-tf value at that bar is available to every base bar whose
 *   timestamp falls inside that interval — and only those base bars.
 *
 * Forward fill is implicit: because higher-tf bars are contiguous in time
 * (within the input series), a base bar at time `t` reads the value of the
 * higher-tf bar whose half-open interval contains `t`. If no such bar exists
 * (i.e. `t` is before the first higher-tf bar's open), the output is `null`.
 *
 * Gap handling: if the higher-tf series has a hole (bar N+1's open is more
 * than `targetIntervalMs` after bar N's open), base bars in that hole get the
 * value of bar N. This matches the forward-fill intuition users have — once
 * a higher-tf value exists, it stays visible until the next bucket opens.
 *
 * Lookahead-bias test (spelled out so it survives regressions):
 *   - hbar opens at 09:00 with value 100, targetIntervalMs = 1h.
 *   - base bar at 09:00 → value 100 (open of the bucket).
 *   - base bar at 09:59 → value 100 (still inside the bucket).
 *   - base bar at 08:55 → null (before the bucket opens — using 100 here
 *     would be lookahead).
 *
 * Performance: O(B + H) using a synced two-pointer walk (both inputs are
 * sorted by timestamp). Callers typically have B ≫ H (many fine bars per
 * coarse bar), so we step through `baseBars` linearly while advancing the
 * higher-tf cursor whenever the next bucket opens at or before `t`.
