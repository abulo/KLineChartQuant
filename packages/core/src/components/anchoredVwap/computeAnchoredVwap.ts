/**
 * Pure math: anchored VWAP + volume-weighted standard-deviation bands.
 *
 * Used by `createAnchoredVwapController` for the from-scratch path
 * (`setBars`, `addAnchor`, `updateAnchor` when `barIndex` changes). The
 * controller's incremental `appendBar` reuses the same formulas via
 * running sums; the controller's tests pin equivalence between the two
 * paths.
 *
 * Math summary (formal derivation in `docs/ROADMAP.md` §3):
 *
 *   typicalPrice(j) = (H[j] + L[j] + C[j]) / 3
 *   vwp(j)          = typicalPrice(j) * V[j]
 *   sumVwp(i)       = Σ_{j=a..i} vwp(j)
 *   sumVol(i)       = Σ_{j=a..i} V[j]
 *   AVWAP(i)        = sumVwp(i) / sumVol(i)               (when sumVol > 0)
 *
 *   ─── important subtlety ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   The standard-deviation bands MUST use the **prevailing** AVWAP(j) at
 *   each bar j ∈ [a..i], NOT the final AVWAP(i). Naive implementations that
 *   reuse the final mean understate the deviation early in the anchor and
 *   overstate it late — the bands wind up visibly off-centre on long
 *   anchors. The dedicated test
 *   `computeAnchoredVwap.test.ts → "bands use prevailing AVWAP at j"` pins
 *   this and would catch a regression to the wrong formula.
 *
 *   sqDev(j)        = (typicalPrice(j) - AVWAP(j))^2 * V[j]
 *   sumSqDev(i)     = Σ_{j=a..i} sqDev(j)
 *   variance(i)     = sumSqDev(i) / sumVol(i)
 *   stdDev(i)       = sqrt(variance(i))
 *   upper1(i)       = AVWAP(i) + stdDev(i)
 *   lower1(i)       = AVWAP(i) - stdDev(i)
 *   upper2(i)       = AVWAP(i) + 2 * stdDev(i)
 *   lower2(i)       = AVWAP(i) - 2 * stdDev(i)
 *
 * Zero-volume handling:
 *   - A bar with `volume === 0` contributes 0 to numerator, 0 to
 *     denominator, and 0 to the squared-deviation sum. The cumulative
 *     volume is unchanged.
 *   - If the cumulative volume is still > 0 at this bar (i.e. there was a
 *     prior non-zero bar) the AVWAP and bands **carry forward** the prior
 *     values — they are still mathematically well-defined.
 *   - If the cumulative volume is 0 (i.e. the anchor bar itself has
 *     volume 0 and every subsequent bar so far has volume 0 too), the
 *     point's `vwap` and band fields are `NaN`. The series still has an
 *     entry for the bar — `barIndex` and `cumulativeVolume` are filled in.
