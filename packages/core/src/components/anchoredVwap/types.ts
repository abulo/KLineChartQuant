/**
 * Anchored VWAP — public type contract.
 *
 * Anchored VWAP (AVWAP) is a volume-weighted average price calculation that
 * starts from a specific, user-chosen anchor bar rather than rolling over a
 * fixed window. Institutional traders anchor to earnings prints, swing
 * highs/lows, session opens, or macro events and read the resulting line as
 * a "fair price" reference from that moment forward. The ±1σ / ±2σ bands
 * around the AVWAP form a volume-weighted standard-deviation envelope that
 * is widely used for mean-reversion entries and exits.
 *
 * TradingView restricts the **number** of simultaneous AVWAP anchors on
 * lower tiers; this controller is multi-anchor by design — every anchor
 * tracks its own cumulative sums so incremental `appendBar` is O(1) per
 * anchor per bar.
 *
 * This module owns the **data model + math only**. Rendering belongs to the
 * `@klinechart-quant/core` Renderer/Scene layer (or a Vue/React adapter).
 *
 * See `docs/ROADMAP.md` §3 for the broader controller layering this fits
 * into. The dispose-guard pattern follows
 * `createIndicatorSelectorController.ts`.
