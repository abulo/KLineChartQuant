/**
 * Footprint Chart — public type contract.
 *
 * A Footprint chart expands each candle internally to show, at every price
 * level, how much aggressive buying (lifting the ASK) and aggressive selling
 * (hitting the BID) traded. It is the core tool of "order flow" reading:
 * traders use it to answer "did this bar rise because there were real buyers,
 * or only because sellers withdrew?".
 *
 * This module owns the **data model + classification math only**. Rendering
 * belongs to the `@klinechart-quant/core` Renderer/Scene layer; the planned
 * GPU compute path is sketched in `computeShader.wgsl.md`.
 *
 * See `docs/ROADMAP.md` §3.3 (Footprint) for the algorithm rationale and §0
 * for how this controller fits the seven-module core layering.
 *
 * Cross-references:
 *   - `aggressor.ts`   — buy/sell classification (explicit, tick rule, Lee-Ready)
 *   - `perBarStats.ts` — delta, cumulative delta, diagonal imbalance
 *   - `createFootprintController.ts` — streaming controller (Signal<bars>)
