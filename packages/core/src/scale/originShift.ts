/**
 * Origin-shift policy — ROADMAP §2.5, refined per the upstream PR feedback
 * about *rebaseline drift*.
 *
 * Background.  GPUs run fp32 (~7 decimal digits of precision). At BTC-tier
 * prices (~67,000) and tick sizes (~0.01) the absolute price burns most of
 * the mantissa, and a subtraction like `(p - pMin)` inside a zoomed-in
 * sub-dollar range produces catastrophic cancellation. The cheap fix is to
 * subtract a "reference value" `ref` on the CPU (which is fp64 and can spare
 * it) before uploading, so the GPU only ever sees relative deltas in the
 * 0.1-or-so range.
 *
 * Why this is its own policy object, and why **threshold-based**:
 *
 *   The naive implementation — "every frame, set `ref = midpoint of current
 *   visible range`" — looks right but is actively harmful on pan. Every time
 *   the user drags one logical pixel, `ref` changes by one logical-pixel-of-
 *   price, and *all* prices get re-quantized to a slightly different fp32
 *   rounding. The result is a continuous, sub-pixel **shimmer** of the entire
 *   chart that the eye perceives as soft jitter even when no actual data has
 *   changed. (This is the bug I flagged on the upstream PR.)
 *
 *   The fix is to keep `ref` *stable* until the visible-range center has
 *   drifted far enough that the fp32 budget is at risk of being exhausted —
 *   then rebaseline once, deliberately. The visible artifact becomes a single
 *   imperceptible discrete snap, instead of a continuous wobble.
 *
 *   In practice 1% of the visible range works well: at a 100-dollar range you
 *   tolerate `ref` being 1 dollar off-center before re-snapping, which is
 *   nowhere near the fp32 cliff but cuts rebaselines from "every frame" to
 *   a handful per pan gesture.
 *
 * Edge cases worth documenting:
 *
 *  - `threshold === 0` forces a rebaseline on *every* call where the midpoint
 *    differs from `ref` at all — this is the legacy "naive" behaviour, kept
 *    for parity tests against the bug we're avoiding.
 *
 *  - `threshold >= 1` effectively disables rebaselining, useful when an
 *    adapter wants to manage `ref` externally.
 *
 *  - A `currentRange` of zero (degenerate, visibleMin === visibleMax) is
 *    treated as "no signal" — we don't rebaseline because we cannot compute a
 *    meaningful normalized drift. The caller is responsible for handling the
 *    degenerate range elsewhere.
