 * Timeline — bar-index ↔ timestamp navigation.
 *
 * A `BarCalendar` is the authoritative list of bar open-times in
 * milliseconds. Real markets aren't uniformly spaced: there are weekend
 * gaps, half-day holiday closes, exchange maintenance windows, etc. The
 * timeline functions must honor those gaps exactly — bar N and bar N+1 can
 * be 60 seconds apart on a Tuesday and three days apart Friday→Monday.
 *
 * Both functions are pure and total: out-of-range inputs return `null`
 * instead of throwing. Callers (e.g. the replay controller, the crosshair
 * tooltip) should treat `null` as "no data at that position".
