/**
 * Bar Replay — public types.
 *
 * The replay subsystem models a playhead that scrubs through a finite bar
 * series. Three pacing strategies are supported:
 *
 *   - `bar`       step-by-bar; `tick()` is a no-op, callers drive position
 *                 via `stepForward` / `stepBackward` (keyboard-driven).
 *   - `wallclock` real-time playback; `tick(deltaMs)` advances by
 *                 `(deltaMs / msPerBar) * speed` bars. `speed` is a
 *                 multiplier (1 = realtime, 10 = 10x).
 *   - `tick`      synthetic tick replay; `tick(deltaMs)` advances by
 *                 `(deltaMs / 100) * speed` bars (100ms per nominal step).
 *
 * Why this matters: TradingView's Bar Replay is wall-clock only and hides its
 * state. Ours is observable via the `state` signal — any backtest engine,
 * recording session, or sibling controller can subscribe and react to
 * playhead changes deterministically.
